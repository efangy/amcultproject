									<h2>Analysis:</h2>

                                     Many of TASA’s events were very heavily focused on food, as more of their “well-known” events include Hotpot Night, Dumpling Night, and Taste of Taiwan. Even their family systems implemented this year were named after Taiwan’s most famous “dishes” and desserts, such as the “xiao long bao”, “beef noodle soup”, as well as “chua bing”. While it is not entirely possible to reflect an entire culture through the duration of a single year, TASA tries to incorporate as much culture as they can into their events. Most board members that we interviewed also heavily emphasized the importance of “eating” and food customs in Taiwan in general throughout their interviews, which indicates their motivation for continuously implementing food-related events. Food in Taiwanese culture serves to bring people together and also defines social groups. Those who eat together are often indicative of “family” and sharing of food reinforces social connections (“Culture of Taiwan”, 1). Social connections are also a huge aspect of Taiwanese culture, as the basis of social relationships stem from the Taiwanese belief that “one cannot do everything alone and requires cooperation with others” (“Culture of Taiwan”, 1). This indicates the heavy emphasis that Taiwanese culture has on factors such as food as well as family and community, which TASA embodies through their events as well as through the community aspect they introduce within board and with members through the family system. As a result, in terms of cultural aspects, we believe that TASA does succeed in its mission to effectively preserve Taiwanese culture.

                                    <h2>Quotes from Board Members</h2>
                                    <blockquote>
                                    “I wouldn’t say it necessarily expanded my knowledge but more of other people, through the events we did, required us to teach people certain things and helped me reinforce our understanding”
                                    <br> - Derek Shao, 2018-2019 TASA Freshman Representative
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <blockquote>
“Skate night and movie night not cultural but in terms of the future is something that can be pushed in a cultural direction” <br>
                                        - Max Tsao, 2018-2019 TASA Internal Programming Chair </blockquote>

                                    <blockquote>
“I think a big way / main way we celebrate our culture and our events, through food (dumpling, hot pot, Taste of Taiwan is ⅓ food) to share our palettes and just to share cultural taste w/ people who might not be familiar with it “ <br>
                                        - Serena Yee, 2018-2019 TASA Internal Programming Chair, 2019-2020 TASA Co-President </blockquote>
                                    <blockquote>

“Taiwan is very focused on food, we’re very famous for our food. At the event, people really enjoyed the food as well so I think compared to other shows, it’s not as emphasized on performances. The performances weren’t very Taiwanese, but the food and activities we made it as close as to what we find in Taiwan. People probably would feel that people are very focused on food and activities." <br>
                                        - Curtis Fang, 2018-2019 TASA Co-President </blockquote>

<blockquote>
“But the food is such a big part of Taiwanese culture and what we wanted to bring to the event and what ultimately what makes our different so different than the other culture shows. " <br>
- Curtis Fang, 2018-2019 TASA Co-President </blockquote>
