										<h1>Conclusion</h1>

On the University of Michigan campus, it can be argued that TASA effectively carries out their mission and vision by implementing many culturally relevant events as well as cultivating a relatively tight-knit community where people are able to meet each other. Through Taste of Taiwan, which is TASA’s biggest event, members are able to mingle within themselves while also learning about Taiwanese foods, games, and prizes. Although the performances at this event weren’t as culturally relevant, they helped to bring people into the event and provide more an “entertainment” value. However, it is also clear that this “larger-scale” aspect of this event was the most poorly executed and many thought was not indicative of Taiwanese culture. However, the “small-scale”, food-related events are representative of the huge food culture represented all through Taiwan.
<br> <br>
Similarly, it can be argued that KSA does a fair job of representing modern Korean culture, which emphasizes K-Pop, aesthetics, and “work hard, play hard”. As 2018-2019 KSA President Ben Kim stated, “Korean culture starts off really embodying the concept of ‘grinding.’” KSA’s main cultural event, the KSA Culture Show, is put on in order to present both traditional and modern Korean culture, resulting in performances such as Fan Dance and Sinaboro, as well as hip-hop/K-Pop dance groups such as DB3 and Female Gayo. While the two traditional performances were done at the beginning and end of the show in order to “accent Korean culture” (Ben Kim), the large majority of the show was dominated by the more modern Korean acts. This aligns with the way Korean culture is largely perceived by the world today, as mentioned before in the culture section. Although I do believe that KSA could improve in displaying other important aspects of Korean culture, such as food or games, they rightfully represent contemporary Korean culture. 
<br> <br>
Ultimately, however, both organizations stressed the importance of community and family and that is one of the most important aspects they both strive to bring the most onto the campus. For those who are more involved in the organizations, most of the people that we interviewed stated that the most important thing that they have gained is the community. This is largely because being able to meet others with a similar background and grow by learning more about a culture could be a huge building block in terms of identity. Especially because most people are far from home and could potentially be distant from familiar connections to their culture, these organizations serve as an avenue for people of certain backgrounds to express themselves and connect with others with the same interests. 
<br> <br>
Although certain events seemingly are more “culturally educational” than the other, both organizations do demonstrate a lot of cultural values and significance. In addition, TASA more outwardly shows this through its foods events and its small-scale interactive events while KSA demonstrates its “work-hard, play-hard” culture through many of its big, party events. For many of the people we interviewed, they demonstrated that being a part of the organizations have in fact taught them more about their own respective cultures in some way. For example, VP Internal Will Park stated that you learn about Korean culture “anywhere you spend time with people with a Korean background” and additionally supplemented that KSA helped him “re-find his Korean roots and become more proud of his identity”. Additionally, TASA Freshman Representative Derek Shao stated that “I think by being able to teach others, we get to reinforce that knowledge within ourselves”.
<br> <br>
Our hypothesis is supported through our findings, and KSA does seem to display more “large-scale, entertainment” events and TASA more “small-scale, interactive” events, both organizations fairly represent their respective cultures.  Therefore, we conclude that for those who are interested in Taiwanese or Korean culture, joining these organizations may help foster a sense of cultural identity and encourage growth.
