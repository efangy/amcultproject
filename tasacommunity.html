										<h1>Taiwanese American Student Association: Community</h1>
									</header>

								    After initially speaking with several members of TASA board, we realized that a huge contributing factor to the unity of the organization is largely due to it having a "sense of community". To further incorporate this sense of community, TASA created a family system to encourage not only board members to bond with each other, but for TASA general members to connect as well. To gain more information, we asked most of the board members we interviewed to tell us more about what the organization personally meant to them, if they had any personal experiences that spoke to their identity on campus, as well as what initially drew them to joining TASA. We also received input from one of the Family Relations Chair to provide more insight on the relationship of the general members with the board members as well as changes they hope to implement in the coming years to encourage heavier general member bonding.

                                    "The general goal is to educate people on Taiwanese culture as well as bring together a community of people regardless of race -- people are always hesitant to join because “we’re not Taiwanese” but we don’t care because we just want people to appreciate the culture. In terms of joining [TASA], I knew TASA existed freshman year and came to some events but I was just trying to get adjusted to college. Then there was the itasa conference my sophomore year, and it made me realize it was something I could really get into and can make a lot of friends. I also liked the idea of joining a community w/ same cultural background, so I did Games Committee for Taste of Taiwan that year, and thought to myself that I really like enjoy being in this community and I want to give back."

                                            "I joined TASA because of the sense of community I got from it just by going to mass meeting and talking to people. The people are the reason why. You don’t have to be Taiwanese to do Taiwanese things. I think being able to connect with people of similar background and good way to relate to people and have those common things to share. I think it’s special I think to me to share what I think is the great parts of our culture to other people who might not be as familiar. So like our food event, it’s really nice to see people enjoy dumpling night or hotpot night, and a lot of these people have never made dumplings or had hotpot. " <br>

                                            "Within TASA, we definitely emphasize community a lot because a lot of members come from far away places. You can talk to people and feel more at home, especially with people with similar cultural backgrounds" <br>

                                    <h3>Regarding family systems and general member relationships:</h3>
                                    <blockquote><p>"I feel like historically [family systems] it’s been a good idea. We created family relations chair to get on it so that the parents are actively sending out invitations and creating events. [But] it’s tricky because it didn’t work as expected so the first thing was to restructure the entire family system. To do this, we made smaller families and bigger cohorts. Smaller groups can develop more intimate relationships. But we still ran into some problems. Some challenges that we ran into was time constraints, parents have own obligations so we can’t fully devote themselves into planning these events. For future references, we want to help out parents more, plan, and give more ideas for the family events. Additionally, coordinating events and keeping group chats active is hard. This year, people pretty were still pretty inactive in group chats so not as much interaction as we wanted" <br>

                                     <blockquote><p>"Our biggest system is the family system. This is something we pushed for really hard this year. We added two family chairs. Me and my cochair created this position because we do want general members to meet each other and become friends through TASA. Our family system is the biggest thing, I think beyond that just creating personal relationships with people we meet through events. Such as bubble tea chats, where people can come get to know us better and get more involved. Taste of Taiwan also allows people to people to come volunteer and help and join committees. I think it’s really hard to keep people accountable, though, because people sign up for everything in the beginning of the semester. I think we should make it so that people actually commit more to it so people are sure they want to join" <br>

                                    <blockquote><p>"One obstacle this year was our failing family system and we changed that by having family relations chair so that we would be more focused on this problem. Every board meeting we would have a certain amount of time that each family is facing so we would have someone to go to. [But I think this is] something we cannot overcome in one year. It is a new norm and something we need to continue to work towards."  <br>

                                    <h3>Regarding board dynamic:</h3>
                                    <blockquote><p>"Yeah, I think in general we are very close. We try and create this “family” where we don’t really force people to come out. We do have a minimum of “events” or “meetings” you should attend, but we don’t have any strict punishments. We just want people to WANT to come and contribute to TASA and that’s the people we look for on board. I think we definitely have that because people enjoy being around each other. I don’t think anyone on board dislikes anyone else. We are pretty close and are a nice community and a lot of people do hangout outside of board meetings and events. We also do encourage bonding within our board through board retreat, we also do this thing called “m-card swap” where you pair up every week and just have a one on one with different people on board just to get to know them."<br>

                                    <blockquote>
                                    <p>"I think our board dynamic we make fun of each other and are really fun with each other but behind it we are very supportive (for events that we have outside of TASA we support each other if it’s important to them) we do work within them but the heart of it all, we make sure that we have personal relationships and friendships with it. We do mcard swaps that allow you to meet people and get closer to them in general" <br>

Whenever we’re working together, we are creative and excited to share our ideas  which I think is where our strengths come from. We have fun planning things because we are so dedicated to TASA in general and really like a family -- we hangout, we study, support each other in other orgs in general" <br>

                                    <h2>Analysis:</h2>
                                    Community is clearly something that TASA focuses very heavily on. Many of the board members cite that the people that they met were initially very welcoming and provided a safe space so that they felt more inclined to join the organization. Some ways that TASA tried to implement more “community” sense was to create a more stable family system to encourage general member participation within the club. This past year, they created two new board positions called “Family Relations” that is in charge of implementing the new family system. These board positions are responsible for sorting and dividing people into smaller groups within the club so that they are able to interact with each other in more intimate settings. Other ways that board members encouraged general members to get to know board members was through use of  “bubble tea chats”, which were essentially “open hours” where members could just go hangout with board members. However, the family relations chair as well as past and future presidents emphasized that the new implementation of the family system is something that still needs improvement and something that needs to be worked on over time. However, this showcases that the organization is working towards a goal to continue distilling community within the club.
<br> <br>
In terms of the board dynamic, the general consensus of board members states that the board is “like a family” and are very close to one another. They hang out regularly outside of board meetings and people are motivated to come out to meetings and events because they genuinely like to spend time with each other. Although the “family” aspect of Taiwan might not be as prevalent as in Western culture, ultimately, community is still a huge factor in Taiwanese culture.
