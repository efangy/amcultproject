                                    Hi! I’m a sophomore at the University of Michigan studying Public Health. I decided to take Amcult 352 because I wanted to learn more about APIA culture and communities on campus. Although I’m not directly involved in any APIA orgs on campus right now, I identify as Korean-American and have many friends involved in different orgs, so I wanted a greater breadth of knowledge on the topic. 
                                    <br> <br>
                                    <h3>On Korean Culture:</h3>
                                    Although I was born in South Korea, I moved to North America when I was one, so I grew up very Korean-American. I lived in a city with many Koreans, so I never felt completely out of touch with my roots, but I definitely grew up feeling more “American” than “Korean.” Growing up, I knew of Korean culture to be Korean food (which I hated when I was younger) and speaking Korean (which I also disliked). After visiting Korea a few times growing up, I came to associate Korean culture with being very conservative, city life, plastic surgery, and K-pop. In all honesty, modern Korean culture does consist largely of these things; the plastic surgery, dermatology, and other beauty industries dominate the streets of Korea, and K-pop is what many non-Koreans view Korean culture as. Korea only modernized as a country around 50 years ago, so the emphasis placed on modern culture is rightfully done so, with the “work hard play hard” motto. Norebangs (Karaoke), clubs, bars, restaurants, and beauty stores line the large and popular cities in Korea. Korean work life stretches over long hours, and breaks are rare, but everyone still finds time to “play hard.” The Korean lifestyle moves fast, efficiency is praised, and aesthetics are critical.

                                    I’m currently a sophomore at the University of Michigan studying Information. Because my Taiwanese ethnicity is such a crucial part of my identity and because I have been more heavily involved with TASA this past year, I really wanted to use this project to delve into how this community has solidified my identity and how it may have impacted others as well.<br> <br>
                                    <h3>On Taiwanese Culture:</h3>
