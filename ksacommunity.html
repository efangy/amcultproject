                                        <h3>Regarding board dynamic:</h3>
                                        <blockquote><p>
                                    “This year we’re a lot closer, we talk, we gossip, no one at each other neck, everyone understands their role, probably because of the leadership- mindset of the leadership that sets the tone and the culture of any student organization”
                                            <br>
                                            - William Park, 2018-2019 KSA VP Internal 


                                           </p>
                                            <p>
                                            “Very chill -- doesn’t mean that we don’t focus on getting things done...Everyone is pretty close… No drama or inconvenience” 
                                                <br>- Justin Minn, 2018-2019 KSA Freshman Representative
 
                                              </p><p>
                                          “We’re all chill we don’t have any drama or arguments... All board decisions are majority based [we] all have similar mindsets...We hang out more outside of board when we have time and have more events and hang out” <br>- Michael Kang, 2018-2019 KSA Treasurer
</p>

                                    <h3>Regarding KSA perception in the A/PIA Community:</h3>
                                    <blockquote>“Honestly, we are known to be very exclusive group, cliquey and we didn’t have a huge APIA presence until 2 years ago” <br> <br>

“Community aspect is supposed to be in the families but as a whole, I would say that KSA is pretty cliquey and community things don’t work and are too forced and people just keep going into their clique” <br> <br>

“KSA as a whole does represent the Korean community in a certain way; we are very select and particular about who we interact with and collaborate with and it’s kinda negative….Korean people are very picky in general and that’s just representative of how we are as a culture” <br> <br>

“Being able to go to mass meeting just because you have that interest in Korean culture... that’s why I picked our board and shaped that; these people would do a good job of welcoming people into community (I don’t care who you are / where you come from, we’ll have fun)”<br>
 - Ben Kim, 2018-2019 KSA President

                                      </blockquote>
                                   <h3>Why did you join KSA?</h3>
                                    <blockquote>“Because I was welcomed [my Freshman year], it pushed me and shaped my vision to becoming president, have the sense of welcoming and coming to college” <br> 
- Ben Kim, 2018-2019 KSA President <br> <br>

“I was born in the US so I didn’t have a lot of korean background compared to other people -- personally can’t even speak the language, being part of a org like KSA helps me be grounded” <br>
- Michael Kang, 2019-2020 KSA President <br> <br>

“I joined KSA because I wanted to be more active in an A/PIA organization; I do have a lot of friends in the APIA org especially in KSA” <br> 
- Yujin Kim, 2018-2019 KSA Membership Chair <br> <br>

“In my two years on board, there is something just being in the community where you just find your Asian identity - I wasn’t ever really proud of it or really thought of being Korean / Korean American that much, but being part of KSA has allowed me to refind that and helped me appreciate just how important it is to understand your history, culture, where you’re from bc it tells you a lot about your character” <br>
- Will Park, 2018-2019 KSA VP Internal

                                    <h3> Regarding Families: </h3>
                                    <blockquote>
“Try the big/little system that we had 3 years ago or another idea that we came up with is “house” system -- Hogwarts style” <br>
- Michael Kang, 2019-2020 KSA President <br> <br>
“A lot smaller (“big, little”) // 20 people in each family ; more intimate way, you get to paired up with someone that who might actually be friends with as opposed, maybe a pre-survey to match up personality and actual hobbies would be a better way”<br>
- Yujin Kim, 2018-2019 KSA Membership Chair <br> 
</blockquote>
                                    
                                   

                                    <h3>Regarding Culture and Events: </h3>
<blockquote>“Incorporate the board more with the community members, most A/PIA orgs are event based because we depend on people coming out to events. Something we can incorporate is maybe polling people in the beginning of the year, what do you as the Korean community think we should make the theme be, getting people more involved, etc”
- Ben Kim, 2018-2019 KSA President

                                    <h2>Analysis:</h2>
                                   As touched upon in the culture section, community is stressed in both KSA and the general Korean culture. In fact, in the KSA board application, it asks a question about how the applicant will exemplify and create a sense of community within the organization. This year, KSA worked to rebuild their Family System, which put general members into smaller groups (~20 people) of all years, genders, and ethnicities in order for the board members and general members to mingle and get to know one another. The first family-orientated event KSA hosted was a football tailgate, which unfortunately got rained out. In an interview with Will Kim, he stated that the family system was “launched very well...But our first event was the tailgate and because that was rained out and people didn’t come to that, it lost momentum.” Due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the weather, and lack of general member participation, the family system was not as successful as hoped. This does support our hypothesis that KSA focuses more on “large-scale, entertainment events,” although maybe not on purpose. It seems as though KSA as a org does want to continue to the family system next year and incorporate the familial/community aspects into the organization more fully, creating a more holistic organization.
