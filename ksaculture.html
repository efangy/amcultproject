									<h2>Analysis:</h2>
									<p>
                                        
Many of the events that KSA hosted this year were not necessarily “cultural” in a traditional sense. The KSA Culture Show clearly highlighted the more traditional Korean groups on campus (Taekwondo, Fan Dance, and Sinaboro), but this was the full extent of showcasing traditional Korean culture. However, KSA does highlight the “work hard, play hard” nature that many Koreans exhibit through their parties, and they create a social environment in which students can mingle and meet one another. Due to the fact that modern Korean culture has shifted towards the culture of K-Pop, aesthetics, and entertainment, it makes sense that KSA as an org on the UM campus also emphasizes these things. As John Lie states, “one should recognize that the sources of success [of K-Pop] denude and destroy whatever existed of recieved (South) Korean culture and tradition” (Lie, 2012). It can be argued that KSA follows trends in culture and hosts events that cater to these trends in entertainment through their showcasing of K-Pop and the large-scale parties they throw. However, from the interviews conducted, it seems as though the familial and community culture that many Koreans embody. For many Koreans, “Personal relationships dominate everything. The family, peer group, and work unit are often the same” (Powers, K.Q, 1996). It seems as though the KSA board exhibits these characteristics; many board members stated that they felt like a “family” and spent time with one another outside of designated KSA times. However, it was also evident that KSA had difficulties with engaging general members into their events, and the family system did not work as well as they had hoped. In conclusion, contemporary Korean culture and the ways it has spread in America is articulated through KSA’s events, but traditional culture and community values could be further stressed.

                                    <blockquote>
                                    <p> “A lot of events didn’t REALLY reflect Korean culture; parties, and culture show. The only cultural significance we had was culture show - it is a really hard process to signify our culture and really execute it well but we’ll try to have more events that are catered to that”

                                   <blockquote>
                                    <p> “First things first, Korean culture starts off really embodying the concept of “grinding” -- people don’t know this, but Korean was a third-world culture until 1980s, major corporations that build their economy, one of the main things that Korean-Americans forget is hard work -- embodies asian communities, as asian people / americans, there are racial stereotypes and racial stigma”
