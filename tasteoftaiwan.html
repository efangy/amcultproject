									<h2>Overview:</h2>
									<p>
                                        
                                      Taste of Taiwan is an annual event put on as a collaboration with TWSA and MTSA where the organizations work together to create a “night-market” like experience. This year, the event took place in East Hall’s psychology and mathematics atriums with the performances taking place in the East Hall lecture hall. The theme was “Keelung’s MiaoKou Night Market (基隆廟口夜市)”, which is known for their colorful yellow lanterns. Upon entering from the math atrium, participants are handed a brochure with a map of all the different foods they can try as well as games they can play.

                                    <h3>Goal:</h3>
													<blockquote>“With Taste of Taiwan, our collective organizations hope to promote our Taiwanese culture as we provide an authentic tour of one of Taiwan’s most beautiful night markets.”</blockquote>
                                    <h3>Planning Process</h3>
                                    	
                                    <span class="image right"><img src="images/tasteoftawaincommittee.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                    The event was mostly planned by a board of “committee leaders”. Committee leaders included board members from TASA, TWSA, and MTSA but general members are encouraged to step up and become committee leaders as well. This way, general members get to be more involved with the organization and the planning process. Some examples of committees included Games Committee, Advertising Committee, Entertainment Committee, Decorations Committee, Food Committee, etc. Each committee leader had their own group of other general members they met up with who wanted to be more involved of the TASA planning process.

														<b>What is the main purpose of your culture show or the event? Was it more for entertainment value or for cultural significance? </b>
                                                        <p>“The main purpose of Taste of Taiwan is for cultural significance. Entertainment is more of the performances and it’s a part of Taste of Taiwan but it’s not the main thing. The main thing is the style of the setup, and we have food, so that people can try a little bit of our culture and get prizes that we do get from Taiwan"

                                        <b>What was the decision making process behind what you chose to have in your event? (i.e. focus on food, games, performances) Do you believe this impacted the way people perceived your culture? </b>
                                    <p> "It’s tradition and this event has been here for a long time, it helps to know what the event is originally inspired by. Night markets are something that you HAVE to do when you go Taiwan so we try our best to replicate that"

                                       <b>How do you believe your culture was presented through your event? </b>
                                    <p> "I think it was represented well. Food for example, we cater from Asian Legend, which is Taiwanese. The brochures have the name of the foods on it (traditional characters) and even on the food committee, we were trying to brainstorm ideas for venue so that we could get food that was in our budget, but are also things that would see in Taiwan. Especially shaved ice with the shaved ice, which is really big in Taiwan, we were really careful when choosing for toppings this year. This year we did “tang-yuan” which a lot of people didn’t know what it was. The games and cultural booths are also a lot what you would see them in night markets in Taiwan"

                                    <p> "Food is the bulk of the cost and also a lot of why people are willing to pay for the ticket is because of the food. Other aspects are equally important but food the most important budget wise"

                                    <p> "We chose Keelung Miao Kou Ye Shi. [We chose] between the presidents of the three Taiwanese orgs and the committee leaders, and we finalized in our first or second meeting. Some themes we've done in the past included “Old and New” and “Jiu Fen”, so we just asked for ideas of what are themes that we could represent in a night market, inspired by a certain night market, or after a movie whether it be more traditional / modern / or even zodiac year. We ended up decided on the night market known for yellow lanterns. We thought there would be great decoration ideas and would be how beautiful it would be in East Hall so that's how we chose"

                                    <p> "The performances were hard to organize because it's hard to get Taiwanese / more Taiwanese culturally performances because there aren’t that many on campus. We also had some difficulties with venue and date and we would have had more Taiwanese performances if it wasn't for that."

                                    <p> "Some things were more logistical, but I think generally, bringing in more Taiwanese performances. Our finance chair talked to a woman with a Taiwanese performance group that we can bring in. We have been limited to student performances but we didn’t really think beyond the campus but [in the future] we can look beyond to the broader Taiwanese community in Ann Arbor"
