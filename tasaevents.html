										<h1>Taiwanese American Student Association: Events</h1>
									</header>

									To gain a better understanding of the steps each club took to achieve their “mission”, and since each organization is largely event-based, we looked at the overall scope of the events that they put on. For TASA, we noticed that they put on a variety of different events. Their “core” events are events that are hosted on a yearly basis while other events this year included a few service events, collaboration events with other A/PIA organizations, and a variety of “family / cohort competitions”. Here is a brief overlook into each: <br> <br>

                                         Hotpot is a very Taiwanese tradition in which people sit around a boiling pot of water with a variety of lots of different meats and vegetables. Hotpot night took place in three separate locations and people were encouraged to attend the location that their “TASA families” were so that food would be distributed evenly.

                                         <h3>Freshmen Representative Event - TASA's Got Talent</h3><p>
                                        Every year, freshmen representatives of TASA are responsible for organizing their own event. This year, TASA's freshmen representatives put on an event called "TASA'S Got Talent" in which TASA members are encouraged to come and show talents. Some performances included talents such as singing, magic, coding "mindsweeper", as well as Chinese yoyo. <br> <br> <br>

                                         <h3>Family Reveal Tailgate</h3><p>
                                        To introduce family systems and integrate them within the club, TASA hosted a "family reveal tailgate" in which all members who signed up for families are encouraged to attend. After mingling with members, people line up to get "puzzle pieces" of their cohort, which are named after Taiwanese foods (xiao long bao, beef noodle soup, and chua bing), to find other people in their cohort. Afterwards, cohorts competed in friendly competition in activities such as human knot.

                                         <h3>Cohort Competition - Scavenger Hunt</h3><p>
                                        Members compete with their cohort to complete a list of “dares” such as lip sync the popular Taiwanese song “Tong Hua” in public and take pictures or videos of the dares that they complete. Cohort with most completed dares wins the competition.

                                         <h3>Cohort Competition - Cooking Competition</h3><p>
                                        Members compete with their cohort to "cook" a dish. The event was modeled after the television cooking show called "Chopped" where each group received a "basket" of ingredients. These ingredients included things such as ramen, eggs, among others. The overall dish is later judged by a panel of TASA board members.

In this event, people were divided into groups and had to work together to create a gingerbread house with a specified "theme". In the end, the presidents of VSA and TASA worked together to rank each of the houses.

Each organization brings a "sweet" that is specific to their culture and are encouraged to mingle with other A/PIA orgs. People typically dress up and a photobooth is included.

                                    To gain a wider understanding of what the cultural significance behind each event, we talked to both the current co-president of TASA and the current internal programming chair to discover the purpose behind the events they chose: <br><br>
                                    
                                    
                                    <blockquote><b>How do you choose the events that TASA puts on annually?</b>
                                        <br>It depends on internal programming chair in terms of planning events, but we try our best to replicate certain events every year. But a lot of the things that we have done aren’t necessarily “traditional”, however we’ve been spending a lot of time giving feedback to improve those events. For example, for movie night this year, we showed Incredibles 2 but I think that we should have played a more Taiwanese movie that could have spread our mission further" <br>

                                        <br>"Some of our big include hotpot night and dumpling night and skate night. Most of them have cultural significance and education in the sense that we are teaching more of our culture. Especially dumpling night and hotpot night, they are much more traditional. We also teach people who come how to make the dumplings for dumpling night. I also feel like all of them have social aspects because we are trying to bring people together. Although skate night and movie night not be as cultural, we are trying to push it in a cultural direction for the future. Our biggest event of the year is Taste of Taiwan, and it is mostly cultural with the food and games and the setting that we try to create in terms of the decorations and retrying to recreate a night market experience. We also have mahjong night coming up, and mahjong definitely has a Chinese/Taiwanese background" <br>

                                        <br>"I think a big way / main way we celebrate our culture and our events, through food (dumpling, hot pot, Taste of Taiwan is ⅓ food) to share our palettes and just to share cultural taste w/ people who might not be familiar with it

                                        <br>We pretty much recycle all of our events which helps with the planning process, we create an archive of every single year in order to keep track of how things are done, what went well, what didn’t go well, how next year can do better. Serena and I followed the archived pretty heavily this year and there was actually one event in particular where the archive wasn't as well written, so I made it a point to make the archive for next year more detailed." <br>

                                        <br>"I think rather than think of new events, which is definitely possible, but the bigger thing is to implement more cultural things that are exist now but aren’t. For example, for skate night, it's possible to maybe play songs over the speakers that are by Taiwanese artists or as people walk in, have booths set up about Taiwanese culture so that they can have something to look at while renting skates. Another one is movie night where we showed incredibles 2. It's a good nice family movie, but also can think of showing a Taiwanese movie or a movie by a Taiwanese director, etc" <br>

                                        <br>"All generally pretty successful in terms of turn out. Some events impact us financially. For example, for hotpot night, we overbought and had too much food. Skate night in general is also expensive, so we can potentially look at sharing the event with other orgs or not renting out the entire arena for the future."

                                <h2>Analysis</h2>
                                Although not all of the events had a distinct "cultural" lesson to it, many of the bigger core events held a much deeper cultural significance. It is also clear by the answers of both the internal programming chair, Max Tsao, and the co-president, Lilian Sheu, that the events that we hold are much more interactive. In events such as dumpling night, members had the opportunity to learn how to fold their own dumplings. In mahjong night, board members helped teach members the rules of the game. Even in the collaboration events that TASA hosted, such as the Gingerbread House Party, the scope of the event involved competing with other groups who attended while working together in a group. However, while interviewing board members, they also emphasized that there were certain events that might not necessarily be completely cognizant (?) of their mission. Examples of these included TASA Movie Night as well as TASA Skate Night. It is important to recognize that both these events tended to have a slightly more "large-scale" nature as compared to many of the other events.<br> <br>
                            In the culture section, we will be looking more closely towards how specific events (such as dumpling night, hotpot night, mahjong night, etc) and customs of TASA align with Taiwanese cultural norms. <br> <br>
