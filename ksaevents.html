										<h1>Korean Student Association: Events</h1>
									</header>
                                    To gain a better understanding of the steps each club took to achieve their “mission”, and since each organization is largely event-based, we looked at the overall scope of the events that they put on. For KSA, we noticed that hosted a few bigger events that seem to be largely "party-based". Here is a brief overlook into each: <br> <br>

                                         <h3>KSA Welcome Party</h3>
                                         KSA hosts a party during the first month of school to welcome everyone back into the KSA community at the University of Michigan, with a special emphasis on welcoming freshman through a KSA hosted freshman pregame. Like most of their parties, it was throw in the Red Room at Necto Nightclub.

                                         <h3>KSA Family Reveal 2.0</h3><p>
                                        This was the main event for the concept of families in KSA. According to the membership chair for the 2018-2019 school year, families were created with the idea of “More intimate way [for members to hangout]; another “friend group” and you would hangout with them and you would do different activities.” This event revealed the different families within KSA and allowed for them to meet each other.

                                <h2>Analysis</h2>
                             Culture is clearly emphasized and distinguished in the biggest event of the year, the KSA Culture Show. This event highlights both the traditional and modern cultures of Korea through performances ranging from Taekwondo and a traditional drumming set to K-Pop dancing and singing. It also works to bring in a Korean-American nature through the incorporation of popular American songs in Seoul Juice (singing group) and DB3’s (dancing) performances. However, most of the other events hosted by KSA are not as culturally significant. Every year, KSA hosts 3-4 parties at Necto Nightclub during point times, such as the Welcome Party, a Halloween Party, and a KSA Culture Show afterparty. These events don’t necessarily align with any Korean holidays or events, but rather reflect American holidays or “college culture.” The events that KSA hosted this year were clearly more “large-scale, entertainment events,” designed to bring in as many people into the events as possible and delivering an entertaining and memorable time for everyone. 
<br> <br>
In the “Culture” section, we will analyze how and if KSA’s events align with Korean culture as a whole.
