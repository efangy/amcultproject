                                     The KSA Culture Show is an annual cultural show put on every year around January or February. It is the largest event KSA puts on each year, drawing in hundreds of audience members. The culture show works to showcase Korean culture through both traditional and contemporary performances, as well as a parody of a popular Korean drama that goes along with the theme of the show. This year, the theme of the show was “Find your Seoulmate,” chosen because the show date was close to Valentine’s Day and influences of social media, such as Subtle Asian Dating.

                                    <p> "Culture show has always been a way to celebrate Korean culture, this show has been around since before I was here. We the rise of K-Pop, we did tend to focus on some sort of kpop entertainment value. The traditional aspect is something we started focusing on more, since a lot of people really enjoy that part of Korean culture and some people don’t know about that (sinaboro, fan dance). We put these types of performances in the beginning and end of the performance instead of the kpop groups because we wanted to start and end with performances that embody Korean culture. We didn't incorporate food, etc, because we don't have ways to incorporate it into the show itself with the venue, and it's also too chaotic in a sense."

                                    <p> "There are certain affiliations we have (female gayo, seoul juice) and we make sure that they have guidelines they have to follow. Female gayo wanted to start/end the show, but we really want to embody Korean culture in KSA show. When we invited OSU/MSU KSA and we personally asked them what performances made you enjoy the the show more, they stated sinaboro and fan dance since they accent Korean culture. In terms of the guest performer, it's something we talked about for a long time, with the rise of Korean entertainment, more chances to bring in Korean celebrity/ artist."

                                    <p>This year it was "Find Your Seoulmate". We decided on this theme because it was near Valentine’s day -- but there’s been a lot of pop culture mediums/shows that emphasize the concept of love. We choose the theme based on what is hot and  what is trending in the Korean culture. Last year it was night in seoul, a lot of people emphasize going out in Korea so we stuck w/ night in seoul. 
We play to the theme in the show to a certain extent. We tell the performances what the theme is and some groups comply and some groups don’t. For example, Female gayo and Seoul Juice did. But for Sinaboro and taekwondo, it's harder. Drama did incorporate what the theme embodies " <br>

                            <h2>Analysis:</h2>
                        It can be argued that the KSA Culture show fairly represents Korean culture of today. The show contains three traditional acts (Sinaboro, Fan Dance, and Taekwondo) and the rest of the show is made up of contemporary acts. The show started and ended with traditional acts in order to highlight traditional Korean culture. According to Ben Kim, KSA reached out to older adults and KSA’s on other college campuses (OSU and MSU) in order to receive input on what audience members deemed as interesting and valuable to have in the show. Feedback showed that audience members found the more traditional acts to be valuable, so the Culture Show Committee decided that they should be placed at the beginning and end of the show in order to ensure that the audience would understand the cultural value of the show. In terms of KSA putting on more “large-scale, entertainment” events, as opposed to “small-scale, interactive” events, the KSA culture show is an accurate representation of this hypothesis. The culture show this year boasted of an audience of around 500 people, selling out the Lydia Mendelssohn Theater. Each act was, at least to some extent, performed with the purpose of captivating audience members. 
<br> <br>
The headliner, Dumbfounded, was included this year because he brought in a “celebrity presence,” is a big name in the Asian-American music world, and raps about issues that pertain to social justice and racism as it relates the APIA community. Although bringing in a headliner was a large financial burden, members of KSA believed that it was, for the most part, worth it. The headliner brought many people in to the show that might not have otherwise come, allowing Korean culture to be presented alongside his performance. 
<br> <br>
When compared to the performances at TASA’s Taste of Taiwan event, KSA’s performances were clearly more grandiose and were more practiced and perfected. This can be seen as a reflection of the aesthetic pleasing nature of Koreans as whole, and K-Pop with its perfectly choreographed, make-up’d, and put together picture.
